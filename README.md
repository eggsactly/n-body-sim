# About
n-body-sim simulates how gravity affects bodies with mass in three dimensional space. This program reads in an XML file of initial conditions of a system and displays on a screen, in real-time, the positions of bodies in the system.

# Building
Run _make_ to build the software. Run _./n-body-sim_ to run the simulation. Run _make clean_ to remove all binary and executable files generated in the build process.

# Running
A good first example is to run the following command:

./n-body-sim -i inputs/SimpleExample.xml -s 0.033 -r 0.1 

That command runs a small example, at 30 fps, which shows a planet clearing the region around its orbit.

# Dependencies
This program is a C++ program and it depends on:
- The [SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/), which must be downloaded separately
- The [Boost library](http://www.boost.org/), which must be downloaded separately 
- The rapidxml library, which has been included in this project.

Unit tests are dependent on [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest), this library is only required for development.

# Support
n-body-sim has been tested on the following operating systems:
- Mac OS X 10.11.6
- Debian 8.5
- Windows 10

Other Linux operating systems are expected to work but have not been tested.

# Coding Standards
Consistancy helps build maintainable code, even if you don't agree with all the decisions. If you contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:
- Always use tabs for indentation.
- Never use global variables outside of classes. Pass pointers to functions and methods instead.
- Never use macros or _\#define_, these are global and their scope cannot be controled with namespaces. Use functions and const variables instead.
- Always call out namespaces explicitly. Never use _using namespace_. _using namespace_ can cause name collisions when libraries are updated.
- Always document classes, methods, functions, structures, enumerations and variables with javadoc comments in the specification (header file). This will allow the code to be automatically documented with Doxygen.
