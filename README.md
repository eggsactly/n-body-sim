# About
n-body-sim simulates how gravity affects bodies with mass in three dimensional space. This program reads in an XML file of initial conditions of a system and displays on a screen, in real-time, the positions of bodies in the system.

# Building
Run _make_ to build the software. Run _./n-body-sim_ to run the simulation. Run _make clean_ to remove all binary and executable files generated in the build process.

# Dependencies
This program is a C++ program and it depends on the [SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/), which must be downloaded separately, and the rapidxml library, which has been included in this project.
