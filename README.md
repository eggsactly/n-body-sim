# About
n-body-sim simulates how gravity affects bodies with mass in three dimensional space. This program reads in an XML file of initial conditions of a system and displays on a screen, in real-time, the positions of bodies in the system.

# Building
Run _make_ to build the software. Run _./n-body-sim_ to run the simulation. Run _make clean_ to remove all binary and executable files generated in the build process.

# Dependencies
This program is a C++ program and it depends on the [SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/), which must be downloaded separately, and the rapidxml library, which has been included in this project.

# Support
n-body-sim works only on Mac OS X and has been tested on version 10.11.6. All other operating systems are not expected to be able to compile this project without changes to the makefile.

# Structure
- headers/ contains the specifications to the programs classes
- inputs/ contains input xml files that the program can parse to bring in scenarios
- LICENSE.txt contains a copy of the GPLv3 text
- Makefile is the makefile for the project used to convert the source files into an executable
- rapidxml/ contains the rapidxml library used to parse xml files and used under the MIT license
- src/ contains the implementation of the programs classes

# Coding Standards
Consistancy helps build maintainable code, even if you don't agree with all the decisions. If you contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:
- Always use tabs for indentation, never use spaces. If your editor does not render them the way you want, consider different editors.
- Never use global variables outside of classes. Pass pointers to functions and methods instead.
- Never use macros or _\#define_, these are global and their scope cannot be controled with namespaces. Use functions and const variables instead.
- Always call out namespaces explicitly. Never use _using namespace_. _using namespace_ can cause name collisions when libraries are updated.
- Always document classes, methods, functions, structures, enumerations and variables with javadoc comments in the specification (header file). This will allow the code to be automatically documented with Doxygen.
